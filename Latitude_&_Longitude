How can we define latitude and longitude in simple words?

1.Latitudes and longitudes are horizontal and vertical lines respectively.

2.Latitudes are parellel to equator and equator itself is also a latitude i.e. 0° Latitude.

3.Longitude intersects with equator at 90° .

other than this

Latitude helps in dividing zones on globe like Temperate zone or tropic zone and they extends to 90° North and 90° south of equator.

However,

Longitudes helps in defining date and time on the Earth i.e International date line and Greenwich meridean line and both are longitudes.They extend to 180° East to 180° west of Prime meridean i.e GMT.

Together Latitude and logitude helps in locating a place on the map .


Note : 
    One degree of latitude equals approximately 364,000 feet (69 miles), one minute equals 6,068 feet (1.15 miles), and one-second equals 101 feet. 
    One-degree of longitude equals 288,200 feet (54.6 miles), one minute equals 4,800 feet (0.91 mile), and one second equals 80 feet.
